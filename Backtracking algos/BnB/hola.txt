Case_1 = Brute force / Naive (which will make your brain rot)
Case_2 = Bounding Functions (To put breaks on redundant stuff/ thingy)

It can be divided into Implicit (Not so clear) and Explicit (Clear) constraints:

1) Explicit (To understand the bigger picture)
x_i >= 0; // 0 <= x_i <= Infinity 
x_i == 1; or x_i==0 //
x_i < 0; //

2) Implicit
